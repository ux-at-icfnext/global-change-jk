    The Department of Transportation (DOT) coordinates with USGCRP and
    its participating agencies to inform transportation system mitigation and
    resilience solutions. DOT initiatives to improve the resilience and sustainability
    of the U.S. transportation sector include the following:

    - The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is working on many fronts to address concerns related to 
    climate change. The FAA is working through their university partners to understand the impacts of aviation 
    activity on climate change and are following a holistic plan to reduce those impacts with other federal 
    agencies through new technologies, sustainable aviation fuels, and improved operational procedure concepts. 
    The FAA is also working to evaluate and mitigate the risks of sea level rise and other impacts of climate 
    change on FAA infrastructure and the ability to safely operate the National Airspace System. FAA is leading 
    an effort to develop an implementation plan for a national airport strategy to provide a top-down framework f
    or investments in airport infrastructure, including resilience.<br>
    <br>
    - The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) are working with 
    States, public transportation agencies, and metropolitan areas to improve the condition and increase the 
    resilience of the Nation's Highways and public transportation systems, respectively, and to reduce greenhouse 
    gas emissions. FHWA and FTA are supporting transportation agencies through ongoing programs that include: 
    assessing vulnerabilities; considering resilience in the transportation planning process; incorporating 
    resilience in asset management plans; addressing resilience in project development and design; optimizing 
    operations and maintenance practices; and deploying alternative fuel vehicle infrastructure. FTA and FHWA 
    are also working to ensure that resilience is considered when rebuilding damaged transportation infrastructure 
    after a natural disaster.<br>
    <br>
    - The Maritime Administration (MARAD) Ports Team is developing a framework for an asset management tool called 
    the “Waterfront Asset Management Tool” (WFAM) to inform port planning and decision making. This asset 
    management tool can be used by public and privately owned ports to identify infrastructure vulnerabilities, 
    establish risk-based asset management plans and prioritize infrastructure expenditures to improve resiliency 
    and mitigate risks that threaten operational stability. The MARAD Ports Team is also working with the 
    University of Arkansas’ Maritime Transportation Research and Education Center (MarTREC) to develop a 
    geospatial “data hub” data repository that will provide a template for mechanisms and processes to compile, 
    standardize, synchronize and integrate disparate data sources related to maritime transportation and 
    demonstrate large-scale data storage and visualization tools that can be used to improve resiliency, 
    planning, investment and operational decisions.<br>
    <br>
    - The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) Offices of Pipeline Safety (OPS) and 
    Hazardous Materials (OHMS) are conducting research projects that address safety, environmental sustainability, 
    and climate change. OPS is conducting research to promote safer systems for underground gas storage and 
    liquefied natural gas facilities, as well as research related to the use and transport of hydrogen and 
    hydrogen/natural gas blended fuels by pipeline. In addition, OPS is hoping to reduce methane emissions by 
    sponsoring advanced research in methane detection and leak control. OHMS also focuses on hazardous materials 
    packaging, particularly ways to reduce risks related to the transport of lithium batteries, and new packaging 
    needed to address hazards associated with emerging energy technologies.<br>
    <br>
    - The Office of International Transportation and Trade engages bilaterally and multilaterally to foster a 
    zero-emission global transformation that addresses climate mitigation, adaptation, and resilience through 
    standards, policies, strategies, research, trade promotion, and technical cooperation and assistance.<br>
    <br>
    - The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Research and Technology is working in partnership with FHWA and 
    DOT’s Office of Intelligence, Security, and Emergency Response to ensure that the costs and benefits of 
    resilience are incorporated into the transportation infrastructure planning process. The goal is to develop 
    nationally replicable modelling tools capable of estimating the regional-scale impacts of natural and man-made 
    disasters on the transportation system. These tools will enhance pre-event planning and disaster recovery 
    capabilities.<br>
    <br>
    - DOT is committed to meeting the Biden-Harris Administration’s climate change goals, including the national 
    target of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. To that end, DOT has re-instituted and expanded the DOT 
    Climate Change Center (CCC) to build on existing efforts to ensure intermodal coordination and collaboration 
    on climate change activities across the Department. The CCC regularly convenes senior career staff and 
    climate change experts from each of DOT’s Operating Administrations, as well as external stakeholders 
    including other federal agencies and the international community, to coordinate research, policies, and 
    actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and make our transportation systemsmore resilient.<br>
