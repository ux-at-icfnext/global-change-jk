        Tropical deforestation and forest degradation are major sources of
        greenhouse gas emissions, and sustainable management of tropical forest
        resources is an important opportunity for climate change mitigation. Many
        tropical forested countries have committed to providing accurate, transparent
        information about landscape changes and changes in forest carbon stocks
        and emissions, but need technical assistance to accomplish their goals.

          report on forest and terrestrial carbon. By providing remote sensing and
          ground-based forest inventory expertise and trainings, SilvaCarbon helps
          countries adopt nationally appropriate tools and methods that integrate

        SilvaCarbon has worked with 25 tropical forested countries to build
        forest and landscape monitoring capacities, promote collaboration and knowledge
        sharing, and facilitate technical coordination globally. SilvaCarbon is
        the primary U.S. contribution to the international Global Forest Observations
        Initiative, an international consortium working to increase availability
        and use of remote sensing data and tools for national forest monitoring.

          Recent SilvaCarbon support resulted in the development of a REDD+ Registry
          for Zambia. SilvaCarbon also supported Fiji, Indonesia, Lao PDR, Nepal,
          and Vietnam in signing the Emission Reduction Purchase Agreement with the
          Forest Carbon Partnership Facility. In addition, with SilvaCarbon technical
          assistance, El Salvador submitted its first and Peru and Honduras submitted
          their second Forest Reference Levels. Finally, the SilvaCarbon Women in
          Forest Carbon Initiative was launched to better address gender disparities
          in the field of forest and carbon monitoring.

      about: Development of the Fifth National Climate Assessment (NCA5) is currently
        underway, with anticipated delivery in 2023. This content will be updated as
        new information becomes available.
      mandate: |-
        The U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) was established by Presidential initiative in 1989 and mandated by Congress in the Global Change Research Act (GCRA) of 1990. Its mandate is to develop and coordinate “a comprehensive and integrated United States research program which will assist the Nation and the world to understand, assess, predict, and respond to human-induced and natural processes of global change.”

        USGCRP comprises 13 federal agencies that conduct or use research on global change and its impacts on society. It functions under the direction of the Subcommittee on Global Change Research of the National Science and Technology Council’s Committee on Environment.

        USGCRP has four major sets of responsibilities: (a) coordinating global change research across the Federal Government, (b) developing and distributing mandated products, (c) helping to inform decisions, and (d) facilitating international research coordination.

        In addition to an annual report to Congress and a Strategic Plan, the GCRA mandates that USGCRP prepare and submit to the President and the Congress a quadrennial assessment, referred to as the National Climate Assessment (NCA), which:

        Integrate[s], evaluate[s], and interpret[s] the findings of the Program and discuss[es] the scientific uncertainties associated with such findings

        Analyze[s] the effects of global change on the natural environment, agriculture, energy production and use, land and water resources, transportation, human health and welfare, human social systems, and biological diversity

        Analyze[s] current trends in global change, both human-induced and natural, and project[s] major trends for the subsequent 25 to 100 years
      engagement_summary: 'USGCRP recognizes that a robust public engagement strategy
        is vital to developing a National Climate Assessment that is relevant to its
        users. The NCA5 process is designed to be transparent and inclusive, with opportunities
        for public participation. '

        label: NCA5 FAQs
        content: "What is the U.S. Global Change Research Program? What does it do?\nThe
          U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) was mandated by Congress in the
          Global Change Research Act of 1990 (GCRA) to coordinate “a comprehensive and
          integrated United States research program which will assist the Nation and
          the world to understand, assess, predict, and respond to human-induced and
          natural processes of global change.” USGCRP comprises 14 federal departments
          and agencies that conduct or use research on global change and its impacts
          on society.\n\nWhat is the National Climate Assessment and why is it written?\nThe
          GCRA mandates that USGCRP deliver a quadrennial assessment, which has become
          known as the National Climate Assessment (NCA). The NCA is required to a)
          integrate, evaluate, and interpret the findings of the Program and discuss
          the scientific uncertainties associated with such findings; b) analyze the
          effects of global change on the natural environment, agriculture, energy production
          and use, land and water resources, transportation, human health and welfare,
          human social systems, and biological diversity; and c) analyze current trends
          in global change, both human-induced and natural, and project major trends
          for the subsequent 25 to 100 years.\n\nHow many NCAs are there?\nTo date,
          four NCAs have been released. The first NCA was published in 2000, and the
          second was published in 2009. More information on these reports can be accessed
          here. The third NCA, Climate Change Impacts in the United States, was published
          in 2014 and can be accessed here. The fourth NCA (NCA4) was delivered in two
          volumes, the Climate Science Special Report (CSSR) and Impacts, Risks, and
          Adaptation in the United States. It was completed in 2018.\n\nNCA4 was released
          in two parts. Will that be the case for NCA5?\nVolume I of NCA4, the CSSR,
          was a comprehensive update on the state of the science of climate change and
          its impacts. It was not intended to be a regular part of the NCA development
          process. \n\nNCA5 will draw heavily on the CSSR and, similar to previous NCAs,
          include chapters that focus on the state of the science of climate and global
          change, responding fully to the GCRA mandate.\n\nWill NCA5 offer policy recommendations?\nConsistent
          with common practice for USGCRP assessment products, NCA5 will be a technical
          scientific assessment. It will not make policy recommendations or evaluate
          existing or proposed policies.\n\nWhen will NCA5 be released?\nNCA5 is currently
          expected to be released in late 2023. USGCRP respects the quadrennial mandate,
          and will work to ensure the assessment is completed as close as possible to
          that timeline while providing authors and staff the time to develop a comprehensive,
          transparent, and authoritative scientific assessment. See the current timeline
          for more information.\n"
