  about: Development of the Fifth National Climate Assessment (NCA5) is currently
    underway, with anticipated delivery in 2023. This content will be updated as new
    information becomes available.
  mandate: |-
    The U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) was established by Presidential initiative in 1989 and mandated by Congress in the Global Change Research Act (GCRA) of 1990. Its mandate is to develop and coordinate “a comprehensive and integrated United States research program which will assist the Nation and the world to understand, assess, predict, and respond to human-induced and natural processes of global change.”

    USGCRP comprises 13 federal agencies that conduct or use research on global change and its impacts on society. It functions under the direction of the Subcommittee on Global Change Research of the National Science and Technology Council’s Committee on Environment.

    USGCRP has four major sets of responsibilities: (a) coordinating global change research across the Federal Government, (b) developing and distributing mandated products, (c) helping to inform decisions, and (d) facilitating international research coordination.

    In addition to an annual report to Congress and a Strategic Plan, the GCRA mandates that USGCRP prepare and submit to the President and the Congress a quadrennial assessment, referred to as the National Climate Assessment (NCA), which:

    Integrate[s], evaluate[s], and interpret[s] the findings of the Program and discuss[es] the scientific uncertainties associated with such findings

    Analyze[s] the effects of global change on the natural environment, agriculture, energy production and use, land and water resources, transportation, human health and welfare, human social systems, and biological diversity

    Analyze[s] current trends in global change, both human-induced and natural, and project[s] major trends for the subsequent 25 to 100 years
  engagement_summary: 'USGCRP recognizes that a robust public engagement strategy
    is vital to developing a National Climate Assessment that is relevant to its users.
    The NCA5 process is designed to be transparent and inclusive, with opportunities
    for public participation. '

        label: What is the U.S. Global Change Research Program? What does it do?
        content: >
          The U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) was mandated by Congress in the
          Global Change Research Act of 1990 (GCRA) to coordinate “a comprehensive and
          integrated United States research program which will assist the Nation and the
          world to understand, assess, predict, and respond to human-induced and natural
          processes of global change.” USGCRP comprises 14 federal departments and agencies
          that conduct or use research on global change and its impacts on society.
      - sys:
        label: What is the National Climate Assessment and why is it written?
        content: >
          The GCRA mandates that USGCRP deliver a quadrennial assessment, which has become known 
          as theNational Climate Assessment (NCA). The NCA is required to a) integrate, evaluate,
          and interpret the findings of the Program and discuss the scientific uncertainties
          associated with such findings; b) analyze the effects of global change on the
          natural environment, agriculture, energy production and use, land and water
          resources, transportation, human health and welfare, human social systems, and
          biological diversity; and c) analyze current trends in global change, both human-induced
          and natural, and project major trends for the subsequent 25 to 100 years.
      - sys:
        label: How many NCAs are there?
        content: >
          To date, four NCAs have been released. The first NCA was
          published in 2000, and the second was published in 2009. More information on
          these reports can be accessed here. The third NCA, Climate Change Impacts in
          the United States, was published in 2014 and can be accessed here. The fourth
          NCA (NCA4) was delivered in two volumes, the Climate Science Special Report
          (CSSR) and Impacts, Risks, and Adaptation in the United States. It was completed
          in 2018.
      - sys:
        label: NCA4 was released in two parts. Will that be the case for NCA5?
        content: >
          Volume I of NCA4, the CSSR, was a comprehensive update on the state of the 
          science of climate change and its impacts. It was not intended to be a regular part
          of the NCA development process. \n\nNCA5 will draw heavily on the CSSR and,
          similar to previous NCAs, include chapters that focus on the state of the science
          of climate and global change, responding fully to the GCRA mandate.
      - sys:
        label: Will NCA5 offer policy recommendations?
        content: >
          Consistent with common practice for USGCRP assessment products, NCA5 will be a technical 
          scientific assessment. It willnot make policy recommendations or evaluate existing or 
          proposed policies.
      - sys:
        label: When will NCA5 be released?
        content: >
          NCA5 is currently expected to be released in late 2023. USGCRP respects the quadrennial 
          mandate, and will work to ensure the assessment is completed as close as possible to 
          that timeline while providing authors and staff the time to develop a comprehensive, 
          transparent, and authoritative scientific assessment. See the current timeline for more information.
