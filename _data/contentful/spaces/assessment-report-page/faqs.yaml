  content: "What is the U.S. Global Change Research Program? What does it do?\nThe
    U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) was mandated by Congress in the Global
    Change Research Act of 1990 (GCRA) to coordinate “a comprehensive and integrated
    United States research program which will assist the Nation and the world to understand,
    assess, predict, and respond to human-induced and natural processes of global
    change.” USGCRP comprises 14 federal departments and agencies that conduct or
    use research on global change and its impacts on society.\n\nWhat is the National
    Climate Assessment and why is it written?\nThe GCRA mandates that USGCRP deliver
    a quadrennial assessment, which has become known as the National Climate Assessment
    (NCA). The NCA is required to a) integrate, evaluate, and interpret the findings
    of the Program and discuss the scientific uncertainties associated with such findings;
    b) analyze the effects of global change on the natural environment, agriculture,
    energy production and use, land and water resources, transportation, human health
    and welfare, human social systems, and biological diversity; and c) analyze current
    trends in global change, both human-induced and natural, and project major trends
    for the subsequent 25 to 100 years.\n\nHow many NCAs are there?\nTo date, four
    NCAs have been released. The first NCA was published in 2000, and the second was
    published in 2009. More information on these reports can be accessed here. The
    third NCA, Climate Change Impacts in the United States, was published in 2014
    and can be accessed here. The fourth NCA (NCA4) was delivered in two volumes,
    the Climate Science Special Report (CSSR) and Impacts, Risks, and Adaptation in
    the United States. It was completed in 2018.\n\nNCA4 was released in two parts.
    Will that be the case for NCA5?\nVolume I of NCA4, the CSSR, was a comprehensive
    update on the state of the science of climate change and its impacts. It was not
    intended to be a regular part of the NCA development process. \n\nNCA5 will draw
    heavily on the CSSR and, similar to previous NCAs, include chapters that focus
    on the state of the science of climate and global change, responding fully to
    the GCRA mandate.\n\nWill NCA5 offer policy recommendations?\nConsistent with
    common practice for USGCRP assessment products, NCA5 will be a technical scientific
    assessment. It will not make policy recommendations or evaluate existing or proposed
    policies.\n\nWhen will NCA5 be released?\nNCA5 is currently expected to be released
    in late 2023. USGCRP respects the quadrennial mandate, and will work to ensure
    the assessment is completed as close as possible to that timeline while providing
    authors and staff the time to develop a comprehensive, transparent, and authoritative
    scientific assessment. See the current timeline for more information.\n"
