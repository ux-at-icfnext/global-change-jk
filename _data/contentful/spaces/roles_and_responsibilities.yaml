    - A Federal Steering Committee is responsible for the development, production, and content of the report as well as high-level scoping to ensure coherence, relevance, and responsiveness to the Global Change Research Act and the USGCRP Strategic Plan. The Federal Steering Committee (with concurrence from the SGCR) selects Federal Coordinating Lead Authors, Chapter Leads, and Review Editors based on a number of criteria, including scientific expertise and experience with scientific assessments.

    - Federal Coordinating Lead Authors and Agency Chapter Leads work across chapters to ensure consistency throughout the report and adherence to development guidance. Coordinating Lead Authors are also the points of contact to the Chapter Leads.

    - Chapter Leads are federal or non-federal experts selected from a pool generated in part by a public nominations process. In consultation with Federal Coordinating Lead Authors, Chapter Leads organize, direct, and lead authorship of individual chapters. Chapter Author teams are established by the Chapter Leads with suggestions from the Federal Coordinating Lead Authors and the Federal Steering Committee. Chapters are submitted to the corresponding Federal Coordinating Lead Author, and ultimately transmitted to the Federal Steering Committee as the individual input of the Chapter Leads.

    - Chapter Authors are selected by the Chapter Leads in consultation with the Federal Coordinating Lead Author and Federal Steering Committee, based in part on nominations via the public call. They are responsible for developing chapter content. Chapter author teams work with Chapter Leads to develop draft chapters and edit those materials in response to comments received during the multiple rounds of review.

    - Technical Contributors provide limited, requested inputs into chapter development. They are selected on an as-needed basis, for specific needs identified by the author team. Technical Contributors may be selected from the pool of publicly nominated authors.

    - Review Editors are selected by the Federal Steering Committee from a pool of experts, including those generated through a public nomination process. Their role is to ensure that authors respond adequately, and provide sufficient justification for their responses to all comments received during the public and National Academies review periods.

    - The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) provides an expert, external panel to review the public draft of NCA5. In addition, NASEM maintains a standing committee to provide advice to USGCRP. That committee is updated regularly with publicly available information regarding the status and plans for NCA5.
