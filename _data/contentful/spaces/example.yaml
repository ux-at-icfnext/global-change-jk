  role_content: |-
    - A Federal Steering Committee is responsible for the development, production, and content of the report as well as high-level scoping to ensure coherence, relevance, and responsiveness to the Global Change Research Act and the USGCRP Strategic Plan. The Federal Steering Committee (with concurrence from the SGCR) selects Federal Coordinating Lead Authors, Chapter Leads, and Review Editors based on a number of criteria, including scientific expertise and experience with scientific assessments.

    - Federal Coordinating Lead Authors and Agency Chapter Leads work across chapters to ensure consistency throughout the report and adherence to development guidance. Coordinating Lead Authors are also the points of contact to the Chapter Leads.

    - Chapter Leads are federal or non-federal experts selected from a pool generated in part by a public nominations process. In consultation with Federal Coordinating Lead Authors, Chapter Leads organize, direct, and lead authorship of individual chapters. Chapter Author teams are established by the Chapter Leads with suggestions from the Federal Coordinating Lead Authors and the Federal Steering Committee. Chapters are submitted to the corresponding Federal Coordinating Lead Author, and ultimately transmitted to the Federal Steering Committee as the individual input of the Chapter Leads.

    - Chapter Authors are selected by the Chapter Leads in consultation with the Federal Coordinating Lead Author and Federal Steering Committee, based in part on nominations via the public call. They are responsible for developing chapter content. Chapter author teams work with Chapter Leads to develop draft chapters and edit those materials in response to comments received during the multiple rounds of review.

    - Technical Contributors provide limited, requested inputs into chapter development. They are selected on an as-needed basis, for specific needs identified by the author team. Technical Contributors may be selected from the pool of publicly nominated authors.

    - Review Editors are selected by the Federal Steering Committee from a pool of experts, including those generated through a public nomination process. Their role is to ensure that authors respond adequately, and provide sufficient justification for their responses to all comments received during the public and National Academies review periods.

    - The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) provides an expert, external panel to review the public draft of NCA5. In addition, NASEM maintains a standing committee to provide advice to USGCRP. That committee is updated regularly with publicly available information regarding the status and plans for NCA5.

  summary: |-
    Since 1989, the U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) has submitted annual reports to Congress called Our Changing Planet. The reports describe the status of USGCRP research activities, provide progress updates, and document recent accomplishments.

    In particular, Our Changing Planet highlights progress and accomplishments in interagency activities. These highlights represent the broad spectrum of USGCRP activities that extend from Earth system observations, modeling, and fundamental research through synthesis and assessment, decision support, education, and public engagement. Highlights describe the state of science at the time of publication of each yearly report, and may not reflect more recent advances in understanding. The date of publication of the source report is noted on each highlight page.

    about: Development of the Fifth National Climate Assessment (NCA5) is currently
      underway, with anticipated delivery in 2023. This content will be updated as
      new information becomes available.
    mandate: |-
      The U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) was established by Presidential initiative in 1989 and mandated by Congress in the Global Change Research Act (GCRA) of 1990. Its mandate is to develop and coordinate âa comprehensive and integrated United States research program which will assist the Nation and the world to understand, assess, predict, and respond to human-induced and natural processes of global change.â

      USGCRP comprises 13 federal agencies that conduct or use research on global change and its impacts on society. It functions under the direction of the Subcommittee on Global Change Research of the National Science and Technology Councilâs Committee on Environment.

      USGCRP has four major sets of responsibilities: (a) coordinating global change research across the Federal Government, (b) developing and distributing mandated products, (c) helping to inform decisions, and (d) facilitating international research coordination.

      In addition to an annual report to Congress and a Strategic Plan, the GCRA mandates that USGCRP prepare and submit to the President and the Congress a quadrennial assessment, referred to as the National Climate Assessment (NCA), which:

      Integrate[s], evaluate[s], and interpret[s] the findings of the Program and discuss[es] the scientific uncertainties associated with such findings

      Analyze[s] the effects of global change on the natural environment, agriculture, energy production and use, land and water resources, transportation, human health and welfare, human social systems, and biological diversity

      Analyze[s] current trends in global change, both human-induced and natural, and project[s] major trends for the subsequent 25 to 100 years
    engagement_summary: 'USGCRP recognizes that a robust public engagement strategy
      is vital to developing a National Climate Assessment that is relevant to its
      users. The NCA5 process is designed to be transparent and inclusive, with opportunities
      for public participation. '

      content: "What is the U.S. Global Change Research Program? What does it do?\nThe
        U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) was mandated by Congress in the
        Global Change Research Act of 1990 (GCRA) to coordinate âa comprehensive and
        integrated United States research program which will assist the Nation and
        the world to understand, assess, predict, and respond to human-induced and
        natural processes of global change.â USGCRP comprises 14 federal departments
        and agencies that conduct or use research on global change and its impacts
        on society.\n\nWhat is the National Climate Assessment and why is it written?\nThe
        GCRA mandates that USGCRP deliver a quadrennial assessment, which has become
        known as the National Climate Assessment (NCA). The NCA is required to a)
        integrate, evaluate, and interpret the findings of the Program and discuss
        the scientific uncertainties associated with such findings; b) analyze the
        effects of global change on the natural environment, agriculture, energy production
        and use, land and water resources, transportation, human health and welfare,
        human social systems, and biological diversity; and c) analyze current trends
        in global change, both human-induced and natural, and project major trends
        for the subsequent 25 to 100 years.\n\nHow many NCAs are there?\nTo date,
        four NCAs have been released. The first NCA was published in 2000, and the
        second was published in 2009. More information on these reports can be accessed
        here. The third NCA, Climate Change Impacts in the United States, was published
        in 2014 and can be accessed here. The fourth NCA (NCA4) was delivered in two
        volumes, the Climate Science Special Report (CSSR) and Impacts, Risks, and
        Adaptation in the United States. It was completed in 2018.\n\nNCA4 was released
        in two parts. Will that be the case for NCA5?\nVolume I of NCA4, the CSSR,
        was a comprehensive update on the state of the science of climate change and
        its impacts. It was not intended to be a regular part of the NCA development
        process. \n\nNCA5 will draw heavily on the CSSR and, similar to previous NCAs,
        include chapters that focus on the state of the science of climate and global
        change, responding fully to the GCRA mandate.\n\nWill NCA5 offer policy recommendations?\nConsistent
        with common practice for USGCRP assessment products, NCA5 will be a technical
        scientific assessment. It will not make policy recommendations or evaluate
        existing or proposed policies.\n\nWhen will NCA5 be released?\nNCA5 is currently
        expected to be released in late 2023. USGCRP respects the quadrennial mandate,
        and will work to ensure the assessment is completed as close as possible to
        that timeline while providing authors and staff the time to develop a comprehensive,
        transparent, and authoritative scientific assessment. See the current timeline
        for more information.\n"

      and natural, and project major trends for the subsequent 25 to 100 years.\n\nHow
      many NCAs are there?\nTo date, four NCAs have been released. The first NCA was
      published in 2000, and the second was published in 2009. More information on
      these reports can be accessed here. The third NCA, Climate Change Impacts in
      the United States, was published in 2014 and can be accessed here. The fourth
      NCA (NCA4) was delivered in two volumes, the Climate Science Special Report
      (CSSR) and Impacts, Risks, and Adaptation in the United States. It was completed
      in 2018.\n\nNCA4 was released in two parts. Will that be the case for NCA5?\nVolume
      I of NCA4, the CSSR, was a comprehensive update on the state of the science
      of climate change and its impacts. It was not intended to be a regular part
      of the NCA development process. \n\nNCA5 will draw heavily on the CSSR and,
      similar to previous NCAs, include chapters that focus on the state of the science
      of climate and global change, responding fully to the GCRA mandate.\n\nWill
      NCA5 offer policy recommendations?\nConsistent with common practice for USGCRP
      assessment products, NCA5 will be a technical scientific assessment. It will
      not make policy recommendations or evaluate existing or proposed policies.\n\nWhen
      will NCA5 be released?\nNCA5 is currently expected to be released in late 2023.
      USGCRP respects the quadrennial mandate, and will work to ensure the assessment
      is completed as close as possible to that timeline while providing authors and
      staff the time to develop a comprehensive, transparent, and authoritative scientific
      assessment. See the current timeline for more information.\n"

  label: NCA5 FAQs
  content: "What is the U.S. Global Change Research Program? What does it do?\nThe
    U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) was mandated by Congress in the Global
    Change Research Act of 1990 (GCRA) to coordinate âa comprehensive and integrated
    United States research program which will assist the Nation and the world to understand,
    assess, predict, and respond to human-induced and natural processes of global
    change.â USGCRP comprises 14 federal departments and agencies that conduct or
    use research on global change and its impacts on society.\n\nWhat is the National
    Climate Assessment and why is it written?\nThe GCRA mandates that USGCRP deliver
    a quadrennial assessment, which has become known as the National Climate Assessment
    (NCA). The NCA is required to a) integrate, evaluate, and interpret the findings
    of the Program and discuss the scientific uncertainties associated with such findings;
    b) analyze the effects of global change on the natural environment, agriculture,
    energy production and use, land and water resources, transportation, human health
    and welfare, human social systems, and biological diversity; and c) analyze current
    trends in global change, both human-induced and natural, and project major trends
    for the subsequent 25 to 100 years.\n\nHow many NCAs are there?\nTo date, four
    NCAs have been released. The first NCA was published in 2000, and the second was
    published in 2009. More information on these reports can be accessed here. The
    third NCA, Climate Change Impacts in the United States, was published in 2014

    the United States. It was completed in 2018.\n\nNCA4 was released in two parts.
    Will that be the case for NCA5?\nVolume I of NCA4, the CSSR, was a comprehensive
    update on the state of the science of climate change and its impacts. It was not
    intended to be a regular part of the NCA development process. \n\nNCA5 will draw

  date: !ruby/object:DateTime 2023-02-27 00:00:00.000000000 -05:00
  summary: 'What was the fate and impact of carbon in atmospheric, aquatic and terrestrial
    systems across North America over the last decade? How is it projected to grow
    and impact future climate change, given current scenarios and how can we harness
    current scientific and socio-economic advances in our knowledge of the carbon
    cycle at the intersection of human dimensions to better manage it in order to
    reduce future climate change risks? The just released Second State of the Carbon
    Cycle Report (#SOCCR2, USGCRP 2018) tells you all about it. SOCCR2 is a Sustained
    Assessment series special product of the U.S. Global Change Research Program,
    spanning 4 sections, 19 chapters and 7 appendices across 878 pages, developed
    by a 200+ member international team who produced over 6 formal drafts reviewed
    over 6 times, including by the U.S. National Academy of Sciences and the general
    public before final review and released by the 13 agencies of the USGCRP the same
    day as the 4th National Climate Assessment. To kick-off this special One NOAA
    SOCCR2 Seminar Series âFrom Science to Solutions: The State of the Carbon Cycle
    Assessmentâ, this talk will provide an overview of the multiyear, multi-step,
    interagency assessment formulation and development process. A snapshot of the
    many scientifically significant and societally relevant key findings, as a preview
    of the upcoming SOCCR2 OneNOAA Seminar talks the following Tuesdays (12-1 pm ET,
    Feb 26-May 28) will also be provided. This talk will also focus on potential carbon
    management strategies along with trade-offs and co-benefits of certain actions,
    to showcase the carbon cycle science-derived climate change actions and solutions
    that decades of the interdisciplinary research has rendered possible. '

  headline_section: The Annual Greenhouse Gas Index (AGGI) is a measure of the capacity
    of Earthâs atmosphere to trap heat as a result of the presence of long-lived greenhouse
    gases. The AGGI provides standardized information about how human activity has
    affected the climate system through greenhouse gas emissions.

          substantially over the last several decades. In 2021, the AGGI was 1.49,
          representing an increase of 49% since 1990, the base year for the Kyoto
          Protocol (an international agreement in which countries pledged to reduce

          This indicator measures the average total radiative forcing of multiple long-lived, well mixed greenhouse gases, including the three most abundant: carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide. Due to their long lifetimes and because of transport by winds, these gases become well mixed throughout the global atmosphere. The results were calculated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) based on measured concentrations of the gases in the atmosphere, compared with the concentrations that were present around 1750 (a baseline concentration of 0 watts per square meter), before the Industrial Revolution began. Because each gas has a different ability to absorb and emit energy, this indicator converts the changes in greenhouse gas concentrations into a measure of the total radiative forcing (warming effect) caused by each gas. Radiative forcing is calculated in watts per square meter, which represents the size of the energy imbalance in the atmosphere.Â

          Â provides high-precision measurements of the abundance and distribution of long-lived greenhouse gases that are used to calculate global average concentrations. Radiative forcing for each gas is computed from these concentrations, and total radiative forcing for all gases is used to calculate the AGGI.

          The atmospheric abundance and radiative forcing of the three main long-lived greenhouse gases (COâ, CHâ, and NâO) continue to increase. While the combined radiative forcing of these and all other greenhouse gases included in the AGGI rose 49% from 1990 to 2021 (by ~1.06 watts per square meter), carbon dioxide has accounted for about 80% of this increase (~0.85 watts per square meter), which makes it by far the biggest contributor to increases in climate forcing since 1990. Radiative forcing from methane has steadily increased since 2007, after having been nearly constant from 1999 to 2006. Owing to the Montreal Protocol, an international agreement signed in 1987, CFCs have been decreasing since the mid- to late 1990s after a long period of increase; however, the current warming influence from CFCs and related gases is still larger than that from HCFCs and HFCs. CFC replacements (HCFCs and HFCs) have been increasing since the phase-out of CFCs.

    influence of greenhouse gases in the atmosphereâthe cause of global warming todayâhas
    increased substantially over the last several decades. - AGGI is a measure of
    what human activity has already done to affect the climate system through greenhouse
    gas emissions. - Decision makers can use this indicator to inform mitigation strategies.'

    The U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) is a federal program mandated by Congress to coordinate federal research and investments in understanding the forces shaping the global environment, both human and natural, and their impacts on society. USGCRP facilitates collaboration and cooperation across its 14 federal member agencies to advance understanding of the changing Earth system and maximize efficiencies in federal global change research.

    Together, USGCRP and its member agencies provide a gateway to authoritative science, tools, and resources to help people and organizations across the country manage risks and respond to changing environmental conditions.

    USGCRP Vision, Mission, and Strategic Planning

    USGCRP's 2022â2031 Strategic Plan sets the course for federal global change research for the next decade. It was informed by input and review from federal agencies, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, and the public, and lays the foundation for meeting new and growing challenges, as well as demands for useful, accessible, and inclusive data and information. The Plan is organized around four pillars: Advancing Science; Engaging the Nation; Informing Decisions; and Collaborating Internationally.

    Under this Plan, USGCRP will continue to build and refine understanding of global change in ways that respond to emerging needs and provide critical information for the benefit of all.

              The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is working on many fronts to address concerns related to climate change. The FAA is working through their university partners to understand the impacts of aviation activity on climate change and are following a holistic plan to reduce those impacts with other federal agencies through new technologies, sustainable aviation fuels, and improved operational procedure concepts. The FAA is also working to evaluate and mitigate the risks of sea level rise and other impacts of climate change on FAA infrastructure and the ability to safely operate the National Airspace System. FAA is leading an effort to develop an implementation plan for a national airport strategy to provide a top-down framework for investments in airport infrastructure, including resilience.

              The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) are working with States, public transportation agencies, and metropolitan areas to improve the condition and increase the resilience of the Nation's Highways and public transportation systems, respectively, and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. FHWA and FTA are supporting transportation agencies through ongoing programs that include: assessing vulnerabilities; considering resilience in the transportation planning process; incorporating resilience in asset management plans; addressing resilience in project development and design; optimizing operations and maintenance practices; and deploying alternative fuel vehicle infrastructure. FTA and FHWA are also working to ensure that resilience is considered when rebuilding damaged transportation infrastructure after a natural disaster.Â Â

              The Maritime Administration (MARAD) Ports Team is developing a framework for an asset management tool called the âWaterfront Asset Management Toolâ (WFAM) to inform port planning and decision making. This asset management tool can be used by public and privately owned ports to identify infrastructure vulnerabilities, establish risk-based asset management plans and prioritize infrastructure expenditures to improve resiliency and mitigate risks that threaten operational stability. The MARAD Ports Team is also working with the University of Arkansasâ Maritime Transportation Research and Education Center (MarTREC) to develop a geospatial âdata hubâ data repository that will provide a template for mechanisms and processes to compile, standardize, synchronize and integrate disparate data sources related to maritime transportation and demonstrate large-scale data storage and visualization tools that can be used to improve resiliency, planning, investment and operational decisions.

              The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) Offices of Pipeline Safety (OPS) and Hazardous Materials (OHMS) are conducting research projects that address safety, environmental sustainability, and climate change. OPS is conducting research to promote safer systems for underground gas storage and liquefied natural gas facilities, as well as research related to the use and transport of hydrogen and hydrogen/natural gas blended fuels by pipeline. In addition, OPS is hoping to reduce methane emissions by sponsoring advanced research in methane detection and leak control. OHMS also focuses on hazardous materials packaging, particularly ways to reduce risks related to the transport of lithium batteries, and new packaging needed to address hazards associated with emerging energy technologies.

            value: DOT is committed to meeting the Biden-Harris Administrationâs climate
              change goals, including the national target of net-zero greenhouse gas
              emissions by 2050. To that end, DOT has re-instituted and expanded the
              DOT Climate Change Center (CCC) to build on existing efforts to ensure
              intermodal coordination and collaboration on climate change activities
              across the Department. The CCC regularly convenes senior career staff
              and climate change experts from each of DOTâs Operating Administrations,
              as well as external stakeholders including other federal agencies and
              the international community, to coordinate research, policies, and actions
              to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and make our transportation systems
              more resilient.Â  Â Â
