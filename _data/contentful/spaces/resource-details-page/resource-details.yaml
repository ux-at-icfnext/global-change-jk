  page_title: Second State of the Carbon Cycle Report
  date: !ruby/object:DateTime 2023-02-27
  summary: 'What was the fate and impact of carbon in atmospheric, aquatic and terrestrial
    systems across North America over the last decade? How is it projected to grow
    and impact future climate change, given current scenarios and how can we harness
    current scientific and socio-economic advances in our knowledge of the carbon
    cycle at the intersection of human dimensions to better manage it in order to
    reduce future climate change risks? The just released Second State of the Carbon
    Cycle Report (#SOCCR2, USGCRP 2018) tells you all about it. SOCCR2 is a Sustained
    Assessment series special product of the U.S. Global Change Research Program,
    spanning 4 sections, 19 chapters and 7 appendices across 878 pages, developed
    by a 200+ member international team who produced over 6 formal drafts reviewed
    over 6 times, including by the U.S. National Academy of Sciences and the general
    public before final review and released by the 13 agencies of the USGCRP the same
    day as the 4th National Climate Assessment. To kick-off this special One NOAA
    SOCCR2 Seminar Series ‘From Science to Solutions: The State of the Carbon Cycle
    Assessment’, this talk will provide an overview of the multiyear, multi-step,
    interagency assessment formulation and development process. A snapshot of the
    many scientifically significant and societally relevant key findings, as a preview
    of the upcoming SOCCR2 OneNOAA Seminar talks the following Tuesdays (12-1 pm ET,
    Feb 26-May 28) will also be provided. This talk will also focus on potential carbon
    management strategies along with trade-offs and co-benefits of certain actions,
    to showcase the carbon cycle science-derived climate change actions and solutions
    that decades of the interdisciplinary research has rendered possible. '
