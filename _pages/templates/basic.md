  <h4> Guidance </h4>

  <h5> When to use the documentation page template </h5>
  <br>
  <p>Detailed information on a specific topic. Use a documentation page if you’re presenting detailed information on a specific topic or theme that has already been contextualized by a landing page. Some topics that can be nicely represented on this type of page include guides or how-tos, technical documentation, and program descriptions — in short, any subject that requires in-depth explanation.</p>

  <h4> Usability Guidance </h4>

  <p>Use a precise headline. A precise headline quickly communicates your page’s purpose. If the page content is especially complex, you may consider using a subheadline to further clarify its meaning.</p>

  <p>Write concise copy. Favor short sentences (and paragraphs) over longer ones, and use straightforward language, avoiding jargon. Remember, copy blocks don’t need to be long to be comprehensive.</p>

  <p>See component-specific guidance. For guidance on specific components, see the page for the individual components.</p>
