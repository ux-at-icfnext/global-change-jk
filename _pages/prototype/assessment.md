      content: >
              <p>The U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) was established by Presidential initiative in 1989 and mandated by Congress in the Global Change Research Act (GCRA) of 1990. Its mandate is to develop and coordinate “a comprehensive and integrated United States research program which will assist the Nation and the world to understand, assess, predict, and respond to human-induced and natural processes of global change.”</p>

              <p>USGCRP comprises 13 federal agencies that conduct or use research on global change and its impacts on society. It functions under the direction of the Subcommittee on Global Change Research of the National Science and Technology Council’s Committee on Environment.</p>
        
              <p>USGCRP has four major sets of responsibilities: (a) coordinating global change research across the Federal Government, (b) developing and distributing mandated products, (c) helping to inform decisions, and (d) facilitating international research coordination.</p>  
        
              <p>In addition to an annual report to Congress and a Strategic Plan, the GCRA mandates that USGCRP prepare and submit to the President and the Congress a quadrennial assessment, referred to as the National Climate Assessment (NCA), which:</p>
        
              <ul>
              <li>Integrate[s], evaluate[s], and interpret[s] the findings of the Program and discuss[es] the scientific    uncertainties associated with such findings</li>
              <li>Analyze[s] the effects of global change on the natural environment, agriculture, energy production and use, land and water resources, transportation, human health and welfare, human social systems, and biological diversity</li>
              <li>Analyze[s] current trends in global change, both human-induced and natural, and project[s] major trends for the subsequent 25 to 100 years</li>
              </ul>
        
              Development of the Fifth NCA is currently underway. Please visit this page for periodic updates on its progress.
