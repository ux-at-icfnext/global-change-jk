## Overview 
Website users are able to print pages using their browser's normal printing functionality. Guidelines related to the format of the information that prints out are included in this section. 

For the optimum user experience, the printed page should save as much paper as possible. Therefore the focus should be on printing the content of the page and not site details or web functionality. It should also preferably default print the page(s) in black and white rather than color, to save ink on users' printers.

## Functionality & Specifications

There are certain items that should **not** print, including full headers, full footers, left rail navigation, menus, breadcrumbs, Search box and button, or banners.

For two or three column printing and article pages, print 1 column with (any chosen) right rail items printing beneath the content area.

### Grid Margins around the content
Default margin should be 1/2 inch

### Text print font sizes
- H1 | 28px
- H2 | 18px
- body text | 14px

### Links
If there are any links within the content, print the full URL after the linked item in parentheses and in blue; do not print related icons such as email boxes, arrows, etc.

For example: [USWDS Design Principles](https://designsystem.digital.gov/design-principles/) ([https://designsystem.digital.gov/design-principles/](https://designsystem.digital.gov/design-principles/))

_Note: There is no need to display external link icons on printed pages_


### Background Colors
If the web page has a background color, that background color should not be printed and instead the content print on a white background

### Footers
The footer should include:
- Url/link of page being printed
- Date Printed
- Page number (if multiple pages)
